## Safety
While attendance and participation in class is important to the class and your learning, it is more important that we all stay safe and healthy.  
Any student who does not feel well must not attend class in Davey Lab.  
If you have reason to beleive that you have been exposed to an infectous disease (e.g., COVID), you should either self-isolate or wear a well-fitting high-quality mask (e.g., N95, KN95, KF94) while in Davey Lab.  If you choose to self-isolate, then you can still earn full credit for reading questions and class participation by submitting reading questions prior to class and submitting lab and project assignments.  
Students should make plans to get a classmateâ€™s notes for any missed class sessions.  
Some of the class sessions may be moved online, based on community conditions or if the instructor needs to quarantine or isolate.  

\\
All students must follow all safety protocols (e.g., COVID) required or recommended by the university.  
University policies and recommendations may change during the semester.  
As of the start of class, current CDC and university guidance is to wear a facemask for 10 days after a known COVID exposure.

While COVID-19 cases have decreased substantially since fall of 2021, COVID-19 remains a pandemic. More transmissible variants are a major concern. Penn State urges everyone to continue to take steps to protect not only themselves, but their colleagues, friends, and the campus by practicing good hand hygiene, staying home if you are sick, being up to date on vaccinations and boosters, and wearing a high-quality, well fitting mask indoors. There is evidence that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 (e.g., Li et al., 2020, Lima et al., 2020, Talic et al., 2021).  Everyone is strongly encouraged to wear masks while indoors, so as to reduce the risk of any class participants getting sick or needing to self-isiolate and to allow everyone to focus on the class, rather than being distracted by safety concerns. 

While some students may be comfortable working in close proximity with a partner on a lab assignment or class project, others may prefer to maintain more physical distance or to collaborate remotely.  Students are expected to respect others' requests for physical distancing.
